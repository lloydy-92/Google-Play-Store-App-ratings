Due to an enormous amount of data points have price values of $0, to stop the results from becoming too zero-inflated skewed, it has been decided to emit all free apps from further analysis for this question.<br/><br/>

Spearman ρ = -0.088, p-value = 0.0348<br/><br/>

Spearman ρ = -0.226, p-value = 0.0664<br/>
It is clear that there are also some extreme values of apps with prices of $300+ distorting the results, so it would be wise to redo this analysis without those values to investigate any potential differnce.<br/><br/>
